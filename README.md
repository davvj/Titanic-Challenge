# Project overview

Ih this prject some machine learning algorithms were used in order to build models that predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. To test the performance of each model, cross-validation technique was applied. In order to get this project done following libraries were used:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- TensorTlow
